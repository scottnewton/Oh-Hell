Oh-Hell
=======

This project was inspired by iterated Prisoner's dilemma simulations with
bots such as the simple yet beloved Tit-for-Tat. (Thanks RadioLab for introducing me
to the idea of simulating the Prisoner's dilemma a few years ago and LessWrong.com 
for recently reminding me of it).

Oh Hell is a card game with fairly simple rules (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_Hell), 
so I thought it would be a fun challenge to simulate the game and 
design several not-so-intelligent bots to play each other. I also hope to design a UI 
eventually so that humans can play the bots.

Note that this is a work in progress at the moment.
